# 👋 Hi, I'm Mohammed Irfan

**DevOps & SRE Engineer | Cloud Architect | DevSecOps Practitioner**

I'm that person who gets excited about automating things that used to take hours. Been working with Linux long enough to know my way around the terminal blindfolded, and I genuinely believe good CI/CD pipelines make the world a better place.

## 🛠 What I Work With Every Day

**Core Foundations**
Linux (my first love), Git (can't live without it), Python (the glue that holds everything together)

**Container & Orchestration**
Docker, Kubernetes, GitHub Actions (been building pipelines that deploy straight to Docker Hub)

**Infrastructure & Automation**
Terraform, Ansible, AWS (spending a lot of time here), Jenkins when the job calls for it

**Observability & Security**
Grafana dashboards, Prometheus alerts, SonarQube scans, Trivy for container security - because visibility matters and security shouldn't be an afterthought

## ☁️ Cloud Experience

I work across major clouds depending on what makes sense for the project:

- **AWS** - My daily driver for most cloud-native work
- **Azure** - When the enterprise world calls
- **Google Cloud** - For those data-heavy or Kubernetes-first projects
- **Oracle Cloud** - Getting my hands dirty here too

## 📚 Currently Learning & Growing

The DevOps world moves fast, and I'm trying to keep up. Right now I'm diving deeper into:
- Advanced Kubernetes patterns (because there's always more to learn)
- Platform engineering concepts
- Real-world workflow optimizations that actually make a difference

## 📝 Sharing What I Know

I believe in giving back to the community that taught me so much. You'll find me:
- Building projects and putting them out there (even the messy ones)
- Writing blogs about things I've figured out the hard way
- Contributing to open source when I can
- Helping others navigate their own DevOps journeys

## 🎯 Where I'm Headed

Working toward becoming that DevOps engineer who doesn't just know the tools but understands when and why to use them. Specializing in:
- Smart automation that solves real problems
- Infrastructure as Code that teams actually enjoy maintaining
- Modern CI/CD practices that don't slow developers down
